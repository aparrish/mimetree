OUR GLOBAL GAME JAM GAME
IT IS A FACEBOOK GAME WHERE YOU MATE YOUR FRIENDS

to run:

- register a facebook application at http://apps.facebook.com/developers; put
  it in sandbox mode; note the api key and secret
- at the command-line:
		python mimetree_web.py --facebook_api_key=<your facebook api key> \
			--facebook_secret=<your facebook secret> \
			--port=<port to run server on>
- choose a port somewhere in the 8900-8999 range
- the html template for the root is in templates/index.html (note the way that
  static files are included)
- javascript and css go in the static dir

you will also need to have redis installed somewhere handy. (we use redis to
cache facebook data.) the program runs with sensible defaults, but you can
override the redis host and port with the --redis_host and --redis_port
parameters.
